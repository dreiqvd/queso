    I'll probably just bore you if I tell you things about myself — it's pretty standard, nothing blockbuster. But if you're in the mood to read, here are some snippets from my non-coding hours.

    <h2 class="font-secondary font-semibold mb-4 text-accent-red inline-block" matTooltip="Meow...">
      Whiskers, purrs, and zoomies
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cats are my kind of people. Our place is a scratch hub for six indoor furballs and a few regular visitors from the outside.  Like most cat owners, it kicked off with one — Tofu, a white Persian. He kinda paved way for the others. We started taking in strays, and well, they just never left. When I am not glued to the screen, you'll find me catering to the royal highnesses — back and belly scratches, marathon support, or just a warm body they can nap on.

      Dark Screen Enthusiast
    </h2>
    <p>
      I've got this thing for dark, twisted series and movies that really make you think — or maybe overthink. Shows like “BoJack Horseman”, “Black Mirror”, or “Love, Death, and Robots”. They're not the typical feel-good flicks, but there's something about exploring those shadowy corners of human (and sometimes non-human) experience that just hooks me. It's like a rollercoaster ride in the dark, you never know what twist or turn is coming next, but you're in for the ride all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      But hey, it's not all doom and gloom on my watchlist. I definitely lighten things up with a good laugh from classic sitcoms like “The Big Bang Theory” or “Modern Family” or shows like “The Good Place” (shoutout to my girlfriend for suggesting this). Young Sheldon gives me and my partner our dose of quirky humor. I am also down for some random documentaries, popular anime, or anything binge-worthy.

      Joint Joysticks and Wheels
    </h2>
    <p>
      Maybe it's the coder within me but I'm all about cracking puzzles and figuring stuff out. This is probably the reason why I enjoy playing co-op games with my girlfriend. We've tackled “It Takes Two”, raced through “Overcooked” (1 & 2, plus all the extra goodies), embarked on adventures in “Tiny Tina's Wonderlands”, and delivered some serious postal service in “Key We”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I also caught the F1 fever thanks to “Drive to Survive”. I  got myself a driving simulator setup which inconveniently takes a lof of our little living room space. The die-hard fans might give me the side-eye thinking I am just another bandwagoner, but I honestly enjoy the adrenaline rush and not just the hype.

      Gambits and Knights
    </h2>
    <p>
      Chess is also my jam. I like plotting moves and outsmarting someone across the board. Sure, I am no grandmaster, but I play quite competitively. In fact, I was a varsity player back in the day — those were the glory days though. I am now just a casual player.   Whenever I'm in the mood for a quick breather or just need a brain exercise, I jump online and have a few matches. Keeps things interesting and me on my toes.

      Jigsaw Snaps
    </h2>
    <p>
      There's nothing like the satisfaction of piecing together a complex image from a heap of scattered pieces. We have some accomplished puzzles hung up as badges of honor.  Puzzles are just a good blend of fun and mental gymnastics, whether it's for lazy afternoons or whenever we're in the mood for a good brain teaser. It's a laid-back way to unwind.
